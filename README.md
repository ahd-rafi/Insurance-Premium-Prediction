# Insurance Premium Prediction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for estimating annual medical expenses for ACME Insurance Inc. Using customer data such as age, BMI, smoking status, and other health-related factors, the model helps in predicting medical costs, which in turn assists in setting appropriate monthly insurance premiums. The project emphasizes explainability and transparency to meet regulatory standards.
